# Template-ATON-EC1000
Zabbix template for PDU ATON-EC1000

Example: what the "bankPower" data graph looks like
![Bank Powers Graph](https://github.com/woodman-sh/Template-ATON-EC1000/blob/main/Images/Banks%20Power%20Graph.png)

This template uses the data and graphs I need, if that's not enough for you, you can get the OID you need from the "ATEN-int.mib" or "ATEN-str.mib" - this is the data of the most recent MIB file package that the manufacturer provided.
